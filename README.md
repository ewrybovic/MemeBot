# MemeBot

A discord bot that will pull a meme from subreddits listed in MemeReddits.csv and post in two ways:
  1. Every 6 hours(current default) in a bot task
  2. By a user command "!meme"
  
 The task will @everyone while the command won't, to avoid notification spam.

Bot makes use of a .env file that I did not include for obvious reasons, so if you want to use it you need to create it on your own.
